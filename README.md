# Pusula Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks for side effect data. It contains separate Python scripts for individual analysis and combined visualization tasks.

## Project Contents

The project consists of the following files:

Task1_EDA.py ⁠: Python script for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset in Task 1.
Task1_AllVisualizations.py ⁠: Python script that generates all the visualizations for Task 1 in a single output.
Task2.py ⁠: Python script for data analysis related to Task 2, including statistical testing and preprocessing.
Task2_AllVisualizations.py ⁠: Python script that generates all visualizations for Task 2 in a single output.

## How to Run the Project

1.⁠ ⁠Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
⁠     git clone https://github.com/ferdenisa/Pusula_Deniz_Agar.git
     ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Navigate into the project directory:
    
⁠     cd Pusula_Deniz_Agar
     ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠Install the necessary Python packages using ⁠ requirements.txt ⁠:
    
⁠     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ⁠

4.⁠ ⁠To run the EDA for Task 1, use the following command:
    
⁠     python Task1_EDA.py
     ⁠

5.⁠ ⁠To generate all visualizations for Task 1, use the following command:
    
⁠     python Task1_AllVisualizations.py
     ⁠

6.⁠ ⁠To run the analysis for Task 2, use the following command:
    
⁠     python Task2.py
     ⁠

7.⁠ ⁠To generate all visualizations for Task 2, use the following command:
    
⁠     python Task2_AllVisualizations.py
     ⁠

Note: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

⁠pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

missingno

scikit-learn

numpy

## Results and Findings

•⁠  ⁠The exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed missing values in key columns like 'Cinsiyet', 'Alerjiler' and 'Kronik Hastalıklar'.
•⁠  ⁠Side effect distribution showed that the most common side effects were 'Ağızda Farklı Bir Tat' and 'Tansiyon Yükselme'.
•⁠  ⁠Visualization of correlations indicated weak relationships between physical attributes (weight, height) and the side effects.
